# PA2-GEALAN

The purpose of this task is to practice and apply skills in array manipulation and data processing.

## Description

1. Normalization problem, create a random 5x5 ndarray, store it in variable X, and normalize it by centering and scaling.
2. Divisible by 3 problem, create a 10x10 ndarray that contains the squares of the first 100 positive integers. Then, identify which of these squares are divisible by 3.
