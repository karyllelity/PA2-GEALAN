# PA2-GEALAN

The purpose of this task is to practice and apply skills in array manipulation and data processing.

## Description

For Normalization problem, create a random 5x5 ndarray, store it in variable X, and normalize it by centering and scaling. For Divisible by 3 problem, create a 10x10 ndarray that contains the squares of the first 100 positive integers. Then, identify which of these squares are divisible by 3.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Operating System: Windows 10, macOS 11
Python Version: Python 3.8 or higher.
Libraries/Packages: numpy (for creating and manipulating ndarrays)
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding.

### Installing

Download the program
- Download the program from GitHub Repository PA2-GEALAN
The following files are included (Ensure these files are in the same directory as your notebook file):
- X_normalized.npy
- div_by_3.npy

### Executing program

Run the program
- Open Jupyter Notebook and load the PA2-GEALAN.ipynb notebook. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the program.
